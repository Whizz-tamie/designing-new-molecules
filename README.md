# Designing new molecules with Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning

## Porject Overview
The design of new molecules has the potential to yield advances which benefit society in fields from materials science to medicine. The key idea is to find molecules which maximize some desirable properties, such as drug eficacy, while minimizing undesirable properties such as toxicity. There are many techniques for this optimization, for example optimizing over the molecular graph, or atom positions, but once a molecule is identified, there is then a second hard problem in devising strategies to synthesize that model in reality. There is a recent research trend in simultaneously addressing both problems: searching in the space of chemical reactions in order to generate molecules which are known to be synthesizable as well has having desired properties. The goal of this project will be to explore some of these recent techniques, with the ideal goal of developing new algorithms to improve the state of the art in this emerging field.
